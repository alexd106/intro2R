#### Getting Help

- [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r): There are many thousands of questions relevant to R on Stack Overflow. [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r?sort=votes) are the most popular ones, ranked by vote. Make sure you search for similar questions before asking your own, and make sure you include a [reproducible example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example/5963610#5963610) to get the most useful advice. A reproducible example is a minimal example that lets others who are trying to help you to see the error themselves.
