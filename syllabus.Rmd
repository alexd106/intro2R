We estimate that this course should take approximately three days to cover all the material in sufficient detail, but this will vary between individuals. How you complete the course is up to you. If you plan to ring fence a block of time to complete the course in one sitting then we suggest the following breakdown for the activities. For many people this may not be an option so we suggest that you try to complete either a morning or an afternoon in a single session.
