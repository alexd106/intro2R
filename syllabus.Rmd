We estimate that this course will take approximately three days to cover all the material, but this will vary between individuals. Naturally, how you choose to cover the material in the course is up to you. If you plan to ring fence a block of time to complete the course then we suggest the timetable for the different components below. However, this may not be an option (or optimal) for everyone, in which case we suggest that you try to complete the material for either a morning or an afternoon in a single session.
